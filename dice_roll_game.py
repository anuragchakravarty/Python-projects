#Project :-
'''
Design a project where as an input student will give a static number (between 1 to 6) and then
roll the dice which randomly generate some value between 1 to 6. The winning situation arrives
when the given static/fixed number exactly same to the number came after rolling the dice.
User can play the game as many numbers of times he wants until user wants to exit, and
whenever winning situation occur some scores must be given to the user, and these scores
goes on adding if user play this game multiple number of times.
Note: Dice contains face valueâ€™s (1 to 6)
